Assesment questionaire

"This we transfer link https://we.tl/t-S5LMlJbm7Hcontains a mock-up for a simple landing page, plus a few associated assets to help you with the page construction.

 

Weâ€™d like you to spend an hour or so putting down the basic HTML and CSS framework to render a page that matches the mock up.  If time allows, a responsive grid would be great.  We do not expect you to deliver the perfect solution, but want to see how you use raw HTML and CSS to neatly lay out assets on a page.  Please provide commentary on any challenges you had, and / or the thinking behind some of the decisions you made.

 

For the video on the page, please feel free to embed this asset (auto play is not required):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV5OJCO_FPY

 

Please can you submit your work by noon this Wednesday (or sooner if at all possible)."
